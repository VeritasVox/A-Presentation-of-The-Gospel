## Who Is God?

Before we talk about sin, salvation, or the cross, we must begin with **God Himself**—not merely as Creator, but as the **self-existent, all-glorious, and sovereign Lord**. The Gospel is not first about us; it is about **Him**.

### The Glory of God

God's glory is not just something He has—it is the **radiance of His being**, the public display of **who He is**. Everything exists *for* His glory (Romans 11:36). He created all things to display His worth, and He redeems sinners for the praise of His glory (Ephesians 1:6, 12, 14). To sin is not just to break a rule—it is to **fall short of the glory of God** (Romans 3:23), to treat Him as weightless and trivial.

### The Holiness of God

God is **holy**—not just morally pure but utterly *set apart*. He is not like us. When Isaiah saw the Lord in Isaiah 6, the angels cried not "love, love, love," but "**holy, holy, holy**." Holiness is not an attribute among others; it is the **total otherness** of God, the blazing purity that defines His very being. To be unholy in His presence is to be undone.

### The Justice and Wrath of God

God is not morally neutral. He is a **righteous judge** (Psalm 7:11), who will by no means clear the guilty (Exodus 34:7). His justice is not up for negotiation. Every sin will be punished—either in the sinner or in the substitute. God's wrath is not an emotional flare-up; it is His **settled opposition to all that is evil**, and it is good that He has it.

Romans 1 tells us that the wrath of God is revealed **now** against all ungodliness, and Romans 2 warns of the day when it will be revealed **fully**. God is not passive toward sin; He is **actively opposed** to it.

### The Sovereignty of God

God rules over all things—not reactively, but *sovereignly*. He does **whatever pleases Him** (Psalm 115:3), ordains all that comes to pass (Ephesians 1:11), and none can stay His hand (Daniel 4:35). This means that history is not random—it is **God's story**, and salvation is not offered on human terms, but **God's terms alone**.

### The Love and Mercy of God

And yet—astonishingly—this same God is also **rich in mercy** (Ephesians 2:4). He is not cold or distant; He loves with a holy, purposeful love that seeks the good of His people. But this love is not permissiveness. God's love is always **just**, and His mercy never ignores His righteousness. His grace is not a blanket that covers sin without dealing with it—it's a **blood-soaked, cross-secured mercy** that cost the life of His Son.

### God Is Not Like Us

God is not a bigger version of us. He is not a buddy, a genie, or a cosmic life coach. He is **eternal** (Psalm 90:2), **immutable** (Malachi 3:6), **all-knowing** (Isaiah 46:9-10), **all-powerful** (Job 42:2), and **everywhere present** (Psalm 139). He is utterly, terrifyingly, gloriously **God**.

This is the starting point. Until you behold **who He is**, you won't understand why sin is so serious, why the cross is so necessary, or why the Gospel is such good news—and such a terrifying demand.

---

## Who Are We?

### Created in God's Image, Yet Corrupted

Man was created in the image of God (Genesis 1:26-27), designed to reflect His character and rule under His authority. But that dignity was **defiled in the Fall**. When Adam sinned, he didn't just eat fruit—he **committed treason** against the King of glory. As our representative head, Adam's rebellion became our inheritance. We are not neutral—we are born in **sin** (Psalm 51:5), with hearts that are **deceitful and desperately sick** (Jeremiah 17:9).

### Total Depravity Doesn't Mean Absolute Evil—It Means Total Corruption

Total depravity doesn't mean we're all as bad as we could possibly be. It means **every part of our being is corrupted by sin**: mind, will, emotions, desires, body. There is **none righteous**, not even one (Romans 3:10). No one seeks God. No one does good. **No one**. The diagnosis is not "spiritually unwell"—it's **spiritually dead** (Ephesians 2:1).

This means we are not "on a journey toward God." We're **running from Him**, blindfolded, in love with our sin, and hostile to His rule (Romans 8:7). And we're not innocent victims—we are **willing participants** in rebellion.

### The Law Exposes Our Guilt

The Law of God—summarized in the Ten Commandments—reveals what God requires: perfect, perpetual obedience. It does not offer a path to righteousness; it exposes our failure and shuts every mouth before God (Romans 3:19-20). The Law is a mirror that shows us our filth, a measuring line that condemns us, and a schoolmaster that drives us to Christ (Galatians 3:24). It says, "Be holy"—and we cannot. It thunders, "You shall not"—and we have. The Law kills our self-righteousness and leaves us crying out for mercy.

### Under God's Wrath and Condemnation

The wrath of God doesn't just hang over the "really bad people." Jesus said in John 3:18 that *whoever does not believe is already condemned*. And in 3:36, that **the wrath of God remains** on him. This is our default state—not morally neutral, but **under divine judgment**. The justice of God demands **perfect obedience**, and we have **none**.

### We Are Not Good People Who Occasionally Sin

This is where modern evangelicalism caves. The popular line is that we're all "broken"—a vague term that avoids **guilt, rebellion, and accountability**. But Scripture is unflinching. We are **slaves to sin** (John 8:34), **enemies of God** (Romans 5:10), and incapable of changing our own hearts (Jeremiah 13:23). We don't just make bad choices—we are **bad by nature**.

### We Deserve Judgment

Hell is not an overreaction—it is the **fitting and holy response** of a righteous God to cosmic treason. Eternal punishment for sin against an infinite God is not cruel; it is **justice**. We were made to glorify Him—instead, we insulted Him, worshiped idols, and lived like He didn't exist (Romans 1:21-25).

This is not where the Gospel ends, but **it is where it must pass through**. Until you know who you are before God, **grace means nothing**, and the cross is just a story. The Gospel is not a boost for the weak—it is a **rescue for the damned**.

## What Did Christ Do?

### The Incarnation: God Took on Flesh

God did not send an angel. He didn't offer advice. He came Himself. *"The Word became flesh and dwelt among us"* (John 1:14). Jesus Christ, fully God and fully man, entered into human history—not as a celebrity, but as a servant (Philippians 2:6-8). He obeyed the Father perfectly in every way. Not one sinful thought. Not one selfish word. He lived the life **we were commanded to live**—flawlessly.

### Substitutionary Atonement: He Took Our Place

The cross is not divine child abuse, as modern heretics claim—it is **divine justice and mercy meeting in perfect harmony**. At Calvary, Jesus bore the **full wrath of God** that we deserved. *"He was pierced for our transgressions... upon Him was the chastisement that brought us peace"* (Isaiah 53:5). He didn't die as a victim of injustice—He died as a **voluntary substitute** for sinners, drinking down the cup of God's fury to the last drop (Matthew 26:39).

This is not mere example or martyrdom. This is **propitiation**—wrath satisfied. *"He himself is the propitiation for our sins"* (1 John 2:2). Either Christ is crushed for your sin, or **you will be**. There is no third option.

### For Whom Did Christ Die?

Christ did not die to make salvation merely *possible*—He died to **accomplish** it (Hebrews 9:12). He laid down His life for His sheep (John 10:11, 15), His church (Ephesians 5:25), and His people (Matthew 1:21). Every sin He bore was punished, every sinner He represented was saved. The Gospel is freely offered to all, but it effectually saves only those whom the Father gave to the Son (John 6:37-39). This does not diminish the free offer—it magnifies the efficacy of the cross.

### Imputation: Our Sin to Him, His Righteousness to Us

At the cross, a double exchange takes place. Our sin is credited to Christ; His righteousness is credited to us. *"For our sake He made Him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God"* (2 Corinthians 5:21). This is the doctrine of **justification**—not guilty by declaration, not by process or effort, but by the imputed merit of Christ **alone**.

We are not made right with God because we clean up our lives or try harder—we are declared righteous **because Jesus fulfilled the Law** and satisfied the penalty. The Gospel is not about becoming worthy—it's about trusting the One who **was worthy in our place**.

### The Resurrection: Death Defeated

Jesus did not stay in the tomb. On the third day, He **rose in power**, vindicating His claims and proving that the Father had accepted His sacrifice (Romans 1:4, Acts 2:24). The resurrection is not a metaphor—it is a **bodily, historical event** that declares Christ as both Lord and Judge (Acts 17:31).

Without the resurrection, there is no Gospel (1 Corinthians 15:17). But He is risen—and that means death has been **defeated**, sin has been **conquered**, and Satan has been **crushed** (Colossians 2:15).

### The Ascension and Reign: Christ Is King

Jesus is not waiting to be King—**He reigns now**. He ascended into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God (Hebrews 1:3), where He rules over all things for the sake of His church (Ephesians 1:20-23). Salvation is not a private experience with a therapist—it is **submission to a risen Lord** who demands your life.

This is what Christ has done: He **lived the life you couldn't**, **died the death you deserved**, and **rose to crush the enemy you couldn't defeat**. It is finished—and now you are summoned to respond.

## What Must We Do?

### Repent: A Total Reversal

Repentance is not sorrow alone. It is not feeling bad, crying during a worship song, or having religious guilt. It is a **Spirit-wrought turning**—away from sin, self, and rebellion, and **toward Christ in faith and submission**. The Greek word *metanoeō* literally means a **change of mind**, but in Scripture it always carries the force of a changed life.

True repentance includes:

- **Conviction**: Seeing your sin not just as bad, but as **cosmic treason against God** (Psalm 51:4).
- **Confession**: Owning your sin without blame-shifting or self-justifying (1 John 1:9).
- **Renunciation**: A decisive break from the love of sin (2 Corinthians 7:10-11).
- **Fruit**: A life that bears visible evidence of a changed heart (Matthew 3:8).

Repentance is not **cleaning yourself up before coming to God**—it is what happens when the **Spirit opens your eyes** to the filth of your sin and the glory of Christ. And it is **not optional**. *"Unless you repent, you will all likewise perish"* (Luke 13:3).

### Believe: Trusting Christ Alone

Faith is not vague belief in a higher power or generic assent to the facts of the Gospel. It is a **whole-soul trust** in the person and work of Christ—leaning entirely on **His righteousness**, not your own. The biblical term *pisteuō* means to believe **unto** Christ, to stake everything on Him—no backup plan, no works-based safety net.

Saving faith includes:

- **Knowledge**: Understanding the truth of who Christ is and what He has done.
- **Assent**: Acknowledging that truth as real and necessary.
- **Trust**: Personally resting on Christ as your only hope.

Anything less than this is **not saving faith**. Faith is not a good work you perform—it is the empty hand that receives a finished salvation. It is not "trying to be a better person." It is **abandoning all hope in yourself** and clinging to Christ like a man drowning in the ocean clings to a life preserver.

### What Repentance and Faith Are NOT

Let's clear the rubbish.

- **Not a decision card**
- **Not inviting Jesus into your heart** (that phrase appears nowhere in Scripture)
- **Not going forward at a service**
- **Not merely believing facts about Jesus**
- **Not praying a scripted prayer**
- **Not fixing your life and trying harder**

You can do all of those things and still be **dead in sin**. Hell is full of people who "made decisions for Christ" but never repented and believed in Him.

### God Grants Repentance and Faith

Even your response to the Gospel is **not from you**. *"No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him"* (John 6:44). Faith is a gift (Ephesians 2:8), and repentance is granted by God (2 Timothy 2:25). This does **not** mean you're passive—it means that when you respond, it's because **God is already at work**.

Before the foundation of the world, God chose a people for Himself—not because of anything in them, but according to His sovereign purpose (Ephesians 1:4-5; Romans 9:11). Election is the **fountain** from which all other mercies flow. It humbles us (we did not choose Him—John 15:16) and secures us (whom He predestined, He justified and glorified—Romans 8:29-30).

### So What Must You Do?

You must **repent of your sin**, **believe in the Lord Jesus Christ**, and throw yourself wholly on His mercy. This is not a suggestion. It is not a soft invitation. It is a **royal summons from the King of kings**—and to ignore it is to invite judgment.

---

## What Happens Next?

### Justification: Declared Righteous Before God

The moment you repent and believe, you are **justified**—not infused with righteousness, but **declared righteous** on the basis of Christ's perfect obedience and atoning death. *"Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God"* (Romans 5:1). This is a legal verdict—not guilty. Never to be reversed. Final. Secure.

But this justification is **never alone**. It is always accompanied by regeneration—the **new birth**.

### Regeneration: A New Heart and a New Nature

You are made **spiritually alive** (Ephesians 2:5). God removes your heart of stone and gives you a heart of flesh (Ezekiel 36:26). You are **a new creation** (2 Corinthians 5:17). That doesn't mean you become perfect—it means your affections change. You now hate sin and love Christ. You hunger for righteousness. You begin to **obey not to earn, but because you love** (John 14:15).

### Union with Christ: The Foundation of All Salvation

All the benefits of salvation flow from being **united to Christ by faith** (Ephesians 1:3). His death becomes our death to sin; His resurrection, our life (Romans 6:4-5). His righteousness is imputed to us because we are *in Him* (2 Corinthians 5:21). Union with Christ is the foundation of justification, sanctification, and glorification. We are not merely forgiven—we are **joined to Christ** by the Spirit, sharing in His death, His life, and His inheritance.

### Sanctification: A Lifelong War

The Christian life is not easy. It's war. The Spirit now dwells in you and begins the process of conforming you to Christ (Romans 8:29). You will battle indwelling sin, face temptation, suffer trials, and endure discipline (Hebrews 12:6-11). But it's a **grace-fueled, Spirit-empowered fight**—and those whom God justifies, **He sanctifies**.

If your life shows **no evidence of transformation**, then you have **no reason to claim salvation**. *"Faith without works is dead"* (James 2:17). Not because works save—but because a faith that doesn't bear fruit **isn't saving faith**.

### Incorporation into the Church

True conversion does not lead to isolation but to **membership in the body of Christ**—the local church (1 Corinthians 12:12-27). Here, believers are equipped, corrected, loved, and held accountable (Hebrews 10:24-25; Ephesians 4:11-16). Those who habitually forsake the assembly call their profession into question (Hebrews 10:25-26). The Christian life is not a solo endeavor—it is lived in community, under the oversight of elders, in submission to one another, and for the glory of God.

### Perseverance: The True Saints Endure

Jesus said, *"The one who endures to the end will be saved"* (Matthew 24:13). This isn't a threat to true believers—it's a description of them. God **keeps His people**, and they **keep clinging to Christ**. Those who fall away prove they were never truly saved (1 John 2:19). Salvation is not a flash in the pan—it's a **lifelong, persevering allegiance** to Christ.

### Assurance of Salvation

True believers may and should seek assurance of salvation (1 John 5:13). This assurance is not grounded in a past decision, but in **present evidences**: faith in Christ, love for the brethren, obedience to God's commands, and the Spirit's witness (1 John 2:3-6; 3:14; Romans 8:16). Make your calling and election sure by growing in godliness (2 Peter 1:5-11). Assurance is not presumption—it is a biblical duty, rooted in the promises of God and the fruit of the Spirit in your life.

### Glorification: The Final Hope

One day, you will be raised in glory. You will see Christ as He is (1 John 3:2), be conformed fully to His image, and dwell with Him forever. No more sin. No more sorrow. This is not wishful thinking—it is **blood-bought certainty** for those united to Christ.

Christ will return in glory to judge the living and the dead (Acts 17:31; 2 Thessalonians 1:7-10). The wicked will face eternal punishment in the lake of fire (Revelation 20:11-15). The righteous will inherit the new heavens and new earth, where God will dwell with His people forever (Revelation 21:1-4). History is not circular—it is linear, and it culminates in the eternal state.

### But Now—The Warnings

We must end where Scripture ends—with clarity and **holy fear**. The Bible is filled with warning passages, not to create doubt in the truly regenerate, but to **terrify the false convert** and expose false assurance.

- *"Without holiness no one will see the Lord."* — Hebrews 12:14
- *"If we go on sinning deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins."* — Hebrews 10:26
- *"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven..."* — Matthew 7:21-23
- *"Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral... nor idolaters... nor the greedy... will inherit the kingdom of God."* — 1 Corinthians 6:9-10
- *"They profess to know God, but they deny Him by their works."* — Titus 1:16

If you claim Christ but live in willful rebellion—you are deceived. If you prayed a prayer but bear no fruit—you are dead. If you treat grace as permission to sin—**you will face wrath** (Romans 2:5-6). **The gate is narrow**, and **the road is hard** (Matthew 7:14). Easy-believism leads to hell.

### So, What Happens Next?

You bow your knee to Christ as Lord and King—not just once, but every day. You kill sin, follow Christ, proclaim His Gospel, and await His return. And if you belong to Him, **He will keep you**. Not because you're strong, but because **He is faithful**.

> *"To Him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you blameless... be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority, before all time and now and forever. Amen."* — Jude 24-25

**This is the Gospel.**  
God is holy. We are sinners. Christ died and rose. We must repent and believe.  
Those who do are saved, changed, and kept—or they were never His.

No fluff. No compromise. **He is worthy—and the cost is everything.**

## A Shorter Presentation

### The Gospel: The Truth About God, Us, and Salvation

**Who is God?**  
God is holy, righteous, and glorious. He created everything, including you, to know Him, love Him, and live under His rule. He is not like us—He is perfect, sovereign, and just in all He does. Every moment of your life exists because He allows it.

**Who are we?**  
We've all rejected God. We break His commands, love sin, and live for ourselves. We don't just make mistakes—we rebel. And because God is just, He will judge every sin. Every lie, every selfish thought, every act of pride—all of it deserves His wrath. Hell is not an overreaction; it is justice.

**What did Christ do?**  
God sent His Son, Jesus Christ—fully God, fully man—to live the perfect life we failed to live and to die the death we deserved. On the cross, He took the punishment for sin, bearing the wrath of God in the place of all who would trust Him. Then He rose from the dead, conquering sin, death, and Satan forever.

**What must we do?**  
God commands every person to repent—to turn away from sin—and believe in Jesus alone for salvation. Not just believing facts, but trusting Him fully, surrendering to Him as Lord and Savior. You don't clean yourself up first—you come to Christ to be made new.

**What happens next?**  
Everyone who turns to Christ is forgiven, made new, and given eternal life. But this new life isn't easy. It means turning from your old ways, fighting sin, and following Jesus no matter the cost. And those who refuse? God's judgment remains on them. There is no neutral ground.

**This is not a suggestion. It's a command.**  
Repent and believe the Gospel—before it's too late.

## Gospel FAQ

### 1. "I'm a good person. Isn't that enough?"

No. God doesn't grade on a curve—He demands perfection (Matthew 5:48). *"There is none righteous, no, not one"* (Romans 3:10). One sin is enough to condemn you. Your "good" works don't cancel guilt—they can't erase the crime.

You may think you haven't done much wrong—especially compared to criminals or morally worse people. But the seriousness of a crime isn't just about **what** you did—it's about **who** you did it against. If you lie to a child, they may just lose trust. Lie to your spouse—the relationship may end. Lie to your boss—you get fired. Lie to the government—you go to prison. Now lie to **the holy, righteous God who made you**? The offense demands **death**. Eternal judgment isn't an overreaction—it's what justice demands when the One you've sinned against is **infinitely holy**.

### 2. "Why would a loving God send people to hell?"

Because He is also **just**. A God who doesn't punish evil isn't loving—He's corrupt. Hell exists because God takes sin seriously. His love offers rescue through Christ, but rejecting that is rebellion, not neutrality (John 3:18-19).

### 3. "Isn't Jesus just one way among many?"

No. Jesus said, *"I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me"* (John 14:6). Buddha won't save you. Muhammad won't stand in your place. Only Jesus bore the wrath of God for sinners.

### 4. "Can't I just believe in God without all this 'repentance' stuff?"

Even demons believe in God—and tremble (James 2:19). Saving faith isn't just belief *that* God exists—it's trust in Christ, submission to Him as Lord, and a turning from sin. **No repentance = no salvation.**

### 5. "What if I don't feel ready to come to Christ?"

The command isn't "come when you feel ready." It's *"repent and believe now"* (Acts 17:30). Waiting for a feeling is just another way of staying in rebellion. If you see your sin and Christ's mercy—**run to Him.**

### 6. "I prayed a prayer once—doesn't that mean I'm saved?"

Not necessarily. There's no magic prayer in the Bible. True salvation shows up in a changed life: new desires, love for God, war against sin, and perseverance in faith. *"Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith"* (2 Corinthians 13:5).

### 7. "What happens if I mess up after becoming a Christian?"

You will. But a true Christian doesn't stay in sin—they fight it. God disciplines His children, not to destroy, but to restore (Hebrews 12:6). Ongoing repentance is **proof** you belong to Him, not a threat to your salvation.

### 8. "Can God really forgive someone like me?"

Yes. No one is too far gone. Paul was a murderer. David was an adulterer. The cross is bigger than your past. *"Where sin increased, grace abounded all the more"* (Romans 5:20). But don't mistake mercy for license—forgiveness costs Christ His blood.

### 9. "Do I have to change my life to be saved?"

You don't clean yourself up **to** come to Christ—but if you truly come, **you won't stay the same**. Faith without repentance is fake. *"If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation"* (2 Corinthians 5:17). Salvation changes you.

### 10. "What if I'm not sure I'm saved?"

Ask yourself: Do I trust in Christ alone? Do I hate my sin? Is there fruit of obedience and love for God? Not perfection—but direction. Don't settle for false assurance. Get alone with God. Open the Word. Don't stop until you know.

### 11. "If God is good, why is there so much evil and suffering?"

Because sin ruined everything. Evil isn't a proof against God—it's evidence that we've **rejected** Him. Suffering exists because creation is cursed (Romans 8:20-22). God doesn't cause evil, but He **rules over it**—and uses even suffering to accomplish His purposes (Genesis 50:20). The cross is proof: the worst evil ever committed became the greatest act of redemption.

### 12. "What about people who've never heard the Gospel?"

They are not innocent. Everyone knows God exists through creation and conscience (Romans 1:18-20; 2:14-15), and they reject Him. No one is condemned for **not hearing**—they're condemned for **sinning against God**. The Gospel is the only way to be saved, which is why we are commanded to go and preach (Romans 10:14-17).

### 13. "Isn't the Bible full of contradictions?"

No. What people call contradictions are usually misunderstandings, context issues, or dishonest twisting. The Bible has stood up to scrutiny for centuries—**historically, prophetically, theologically, and textually**. God's Word is truth (John 17:17), and it doesn't crack under pressure. The problem isn't the Bible—it's our pride.

### 14. "I've seen Christians act horribly. Why would I want to join that?"

There are hypocrites in every group—but they don't represent Christ. God will judge false converts and wolves in sheep's clothing (Matthew 7:15-23). Don't reject Jesus because of the people who **fake** following Him. You're not called to trust in His followers—you're called to trust **Him**.

### 15. "Can't I just follow my heart?"

No. Your heart is a liar. *"The heart is deceitful above all things and desperately sick"* (Jeremiah 17:9). Following your heart is what got humanity into this mess. The Gospel calls you to **deny yourself**, take up your cross, and follow Christ—even when it costs everything.

### 16. "I'm spiritual but not religious. Isn't that enough?"

No. "Spirituality" without truth is just **idolatry in disguise**. If your spirituality doesn't lead you to the real, holy, triune God revealed in Scripture—it's self-worship with incense. God doesn't accept vague sincerity. He commands **truthful worship in Spirit and in truth** (John 4:24).

### 17. "What if I start but can't finish? I'm afraid I'll fall away."

If you truly belong to Christ, **He will hold you fast** (John 10:28-29). Salvation isn't maintained by your strength—it's **preserved by God's power** (1 Peter 1:5). The Christian life is hard, but Christ is faithful. If you fall, He restores. But if you abandon Him and stay gone—you never knew Him to begin with (1 John 2:19).

### 18. "Why would I give up everything for Jesus?"

Because He is **worth more than everything**. *"What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul?"* (Mark 8:36). You can have comfort, approval, pleasure—and wake up in hell. Or you can lose it all and gain Christ. The pearl of great price is worth selling everything for.

### 19. "What about infant salvation or those who die young?"

Scripture does not give us exhaustive details, but it does affirm God's justice and mercy. David expressed confidence that he would see his deceased infant son again (2 Samuel 12:23). We also know that God is the judge of all the earth and will do what is right (Genesis 18:25). Those incapable of conscious rebellion are not held accountable in the same way as those who knowingly reject Christ. We can trust God's character, even where His ways are not fully revealed.

### 20. "What about Old Testament believers—how were they saved?"

They were saved the same way we are—by grace through faith in the promises of God, looking forward to the coming Messiah (Romans 4:1-8; Hebrews 11). Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness (Genesis 15:6). The object of their faith was Christ, though they saw Him from a distance. There has always been only one way of salvation: through the blood of Jesus Christ, applied to all who trust in God's provision.
